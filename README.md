# Windex

Make your localhost look nice with stylized directory listings. No more 1996 jank.

Features include:

+ SVG icons, sized for 24x24 & multiples thereof
+ View HTML files without extensions: `project/page.html` at `project/page`
+ Nice mobile view with big tap targets

## Install

Let's say your root `localhost` folder is `~/projects`

1. Download or clone this project to `~/projects/windex`
2. Move `.htaccess` to the root: `~/projects/.htaccess`

## License

Windex is released under the [MIT license](https://desandro.mit-license.org). Have at it.
